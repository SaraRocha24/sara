### Explaining drug-disease interactions with Logic Programming
In the drug discovery process, lots of novel interactions are predicted using black-box models such as Deep Learning and Neural Networks models. On the other hand, Logic Programming presents a capacity for explainable models for prediction.
In this work, we propose the development of a model for predicting novel drug-disease interactions using Logic Programming, specifically ProbLog. Diseases are described using a consensus model for genetic prioritization, and, based on this model, a metric for similarity/parsimony among diseases is proposed.
Once diseases are described using distance metrics, this work will propose a method for discovering new drug-disease interactions using an interaction database, namely ChEMBL.
